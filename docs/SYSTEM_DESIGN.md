# System Design â€” Quorix

This document explains the architecture and design considerations for Quorix: Event booking notification tem. It covers concurrency, database design, scalability, API design, optional enhancements, and includes Mermaid diagrams for key flows.

## High-level architecture

- FastAPI for HTTP API endpoints.
- SQLAlchemy (async) + Alembic for persistence and migrations.
- Postgres (recommended) as the production relational store.
- Redis for caching and as Celery broker/result backend.
- Celery for background tasks (email notifications, waitlist promotion, analytics batching).

## Concurrency & Race Conditions

Problem: Multiple users may try to book the last remaining seats concurrently. Without proper controls, overselling can occur.

Techniques to prevent oversell:

- Optimistic locking

  - Add a `version` column to the `events` table (integer). On update, include `WHERE id = :id AND version = :version`. If 0 rows are updated, retry (read latest, detect conflict) or report failure.
  - Pros: low locking overhead, good for high-read workloads.
  - Cons: requires retry logic in application code; heavy contention leads to more retries.

- Database transactions with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE (pessimistic locking)

  - Start a transaction, select the event row with `FOR UPDATE`, check remaining capacity, insert booking, decrement capacity, commit.
  - Pros: simple to reason about and reliable when capacity changes are frequent.
  - Cons: locks reduce concurrency; long transactions can lead to contention.

- Queues / Serializers
  - Push booking requests to a single- or sharded-queue; workers process requests sequentially per event or per partition key (e.g., event_id). This serializes booking operations and eliminates race conditions.
  - Pros: deterministic, easy to scale by sharding across events.
  - Cons: increases write latency; requires queue infrastructure.

Recommended approach for Evently (production-ready):

- Use optimistic locking as primary strategy for high throughput. Implement limited retries with exponential backoff.
- For very high contention events (e.g., ticket drops), use a dedicated queue to serialize booking requests for that event ID (hybrid approach).

Mermaid sequence for optimistic locking flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client
  participant API
  participant DB

  Client->>API: POST /events/:id/book (user_id)
  API->>DB: SELECT capacity, version FROM events WHERE id = :id
  DB-->>API: capacity=1, version=42
  API->>DB: BEGIN
  API->>DB: INSERT INTO bookings(...) ; UPDATE events SET capacity=capacity-1, version=version+1 WHERE id=:id AND version=42
  alt update success
    DB-->>API: commit
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
  else update failed
    DB-->>API: rollback
    API-->>Client: 409 Conflict (retry suggested)
  end
```

Edge cases & retries:

- Limit retries to a small constant (e.g., 3 attempts).
- If retries exhausted, enqueue for manual handling or return a clear error message.

## Database Design

Core entities:

- users
  - id (PK), email (unique), name, hashed_password, created_at
- events
  - id (PK), organizer_id (FK -> users), title, capacity (int), start_time, end_time, metadata/jsonb, version (int for optimistic locking), created_at
- bookings
  - id (PK), event_id (FK -> events), user_id (FK -> users), status (enum: active,cancelled,waitlisted), seat_info (nullable), created_at
- waitlist
  - id (PK), event_id (FK), user_id (FK), position, created_at

Integrity between capacity and bookings:

- Keep `events.capacity` as the total seats available.
- To compute remaining seats: `available = events.capacity - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE event_id = :id AND status = 'active')`.
- Denormalize `events.remaining` or `events.booked_count` for faster reads, but ensure updates happen in the same transaction or using optimistic locking to avoid stale reads.

Indexes:

- `events(start_time)`, `events(organizer_id)`
- `bookings(event_id)` composite index on `(event_id, status)` to quickly compute active bookings
- `waitlist(event_id, position)`

Constraints:

- Foreign keys to enforce referential integrity
- Unique constraints where applicable (e.g., only one active booking per user per event if required)

## Scalability

Handling thousands of concurrent bookings:

- Horizontal API scaling

  - Run multiple FastAPI instances behind a load balancer. Keep API stateless; store state in DB/Redis.

- Database scaling

  - Primary/replica for read scaling. Writes must go to primary.
  - Use partitioning/sharding for events if a single table gets massive.
  - Use connection pooling (psycopg + asyncpg) and tune pool sizes.

- Caching

  - Cache read-heavy endpoints (event details) in Redis with short TTLs.
  - Cache computed available seats but always validate at booking time against authoritative DB state to avoid oversell.

- Rate limiting and throttling

  - Protect endpoints with rate limits per IP and per user.
  - For flash-sales, employ queueing to avoid overwhelming DB.

- Other choices
  - Use a queue per event (or per shard) to serialize writes under extreme contention.
  - Use a write-optimized datastore (e.g., specialized counters) if only counts are needed and eventual consistency is acceptable.

---

## API Design

Principles

- RESTful endpoints using clear resource paths and HTTP verbs.
- Use proper status codes (201 created, 409 conflict on capacity conflicts, 400 bad request, 401/403 for auth errors).
- Paginate list endpoints.

Example endpoints

- GET /api/v1/events
- POST /api/v1/events (create event)
- GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}
- POST /api/v1/events/{event_id}/book
- POST /api/v1/events/{event_id}/waitlist
- DELETE /api/v1/bookings/{booking_id}

Error handling patterns

- Return structured JSON errors: {"code": "capacity_conflict", "message": "Event is fully booked"}
- For optimistic lock failures, return 409 with info to retry.

---

## Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

- Waitlist system

  - Users can join a waitlist when event is full. When a cancellation occurs, pop the first waitlist entry and notify the user.
  - Implementation: stored in `waitlist` table with position; promotion handled by a Celery worker.

- Seat-level booking

  - Model seats separately (seat map table) and lock seats on selection.

- Notifications

  - When waitlist promotion occurs, send email/SMS and reserve seat for the user for a short TTL; if they don't accept, move to next.

- Advanced analytics
  - Periodic batch jobs aggregate booking stats and store them in a data-warehouse table for fast reporting.

---

## Example: Waitlist promotion flow (Mermaid sequence)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant API
  participant DB
  participant Worker

  User->>API: POST /events/:id/waitlist
  API->>DB: INSERT waitlist (event_id, user_id)
  API-->>User: 201 Created

  Note over DB,Worker: Later, when a booking is cancelled
  DB->>Worker: trigger or event via enqueue
  Worker->>DB: SELECT next user FROM waitlist WHERE event_id = :id ORDER BY position LIMIT 1
  Worker->>DB: INSERT booking for user; DELETE waitlist row
  Worker->>API: send notification (email/SMS)
```

---

## Engineering notes & tradeoffs

- Optimistic locking + retries gives high throughput but requires robust client retry handling. Use a small retry cap and fall back to queueing for high contention events.
- Pessimistic locks are simpler but will reduce concurrency under heavy load.
- For analytics and reporting, use dedicated batch jobs and separate read-optimized stores to avoid impacting transactional DB performance.
- Consider eventual consistency for counts/analytics where strict real-time accuracy is not required.

## Diagrams

### Booking request sequence (simplified)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant API
  participant DB
  participant Cache

  User->>API: POST /events/:id/book
  API->>Cache: GET event:{id}:available
  alt cache hit and >0
    Cache-->>API: available=3
    API->>DB: optimistic update (version match) & insert booking
  else cache miss or 0
    API->>DB: SELECT capacity, version
    API->>DB: update and insert
  end
  DB-->>API: commit
  API->>Cache: update event:{id}:available
  API-->>User: 201 Created
```

## Final notes

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `.env.example` file listing all environment variables.
- Add a short production checklist to the README describing how to rotate secrets, configure Postgres, Redis, and Celery.
- Convert diagrams into PNG/SVG and embed them in the repo.
